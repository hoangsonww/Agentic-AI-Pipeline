# Robotics Industry Overview (Seed KB)
- Segments: industrial arms, autonomous mobile robots (AMRs), collaborative robots (cobots).
- Buyers: manufacturing, logistics, healthcare; common KPIs include throughput, uptime, ROI < 18 months.
- Typical stack: perception (cameras/LiDAR), planning (SLAM, path), control (PLC/inverter), orchestration (WMS/MES), safety (ISO 10218).
- Adoption friction: integration cost, safety certification, workforce training, uptime guarantees.

## Competitive Notes
- Incumbents: ABB, FANUC, Yaskawa (depth of SKUs, global channels).
- Fast-growing challengers: XYZ Robotics, ACME Robotics (hypothetical seed entity).
- Value drivers: payback period, MTBF, TCO vs labor, service SLAs.

## Common Proof Points for Outreach
- Case-study metrics (throughput/unit-hour, % downtime reduction).
- Pilot-to-scale plan (phased rollout, change mgmt).
