## Short Intro
Subject: Exploring warehouse throughput gains at {{company}}
Hi {{first_name}}, I read about {{signal}} and thought ACME-style AMRs might lift {{metric}} by {{estimate}}.
If helpful, I can share a 1‑page comparing {{alt}} vs AMR. Interested?

## Follow-up (3 days later)
Subject: Quick follow-up on throughput
Hi {{first_name}}, circling back in case you missed this. We usually see payback < 12 months in {{industry}}.
Open to a 15‑min chat next week?
